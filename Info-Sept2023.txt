Briefing
===========
The program is called 'CalSG' and resides in the 'build' subdirectory.
To run it in the parent directory type:
   ./build/CalSG   Run_Beam_v1.mac
There are other test input files in the top directory, and the tests directories.

However the Python application to drive 'CalSG' resides in the subdirectory
  Socket_Program


Output
===========
There are two output files:
  stuff.csv:             a simple text file, a line is one event's energy deposition in each of 5 layers
  TrajectoryData.heprep: the traces or trajectories of the tracks.

The text output is always written -- as each event is simulated.
The 'heprep' file is only created if a 'vis.mac' file is loaded and 
         it's location (and name) are specified there.


Details
============

1) Location of output '.heprep' file

   Output files are stored in the ../Test directory relative to the location you ran the executable.
   This is chosen in vis.mac line:

/vis/heprep/setFileDir ../Test/

   Changing this line modifies this choice / configuration

Configuration
================

-) Use 'local' visualisation or HEPrep output file ?

## Outputting HEPrep output file:
To enable output in the HEPrep file format, the command is:

  /vis/open HepRepFile

Commenting it out using '#' at the start of line disables it.

-) How to Use 'local' visualisation or HEPrep output file ?

Edit the file 'vis.mac' to enable / disable local OpenGL visualisation:
The following line enables local visualization (useful to check, debug or
understand what is happening): 

  # /vis/open OGL 600x600-0+0
    The line must be commented out:

It can be turned on for local tests by uncommenting it:

   /vis/open OGL 600x600-0+0
